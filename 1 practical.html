    <h2>STATISTICS</h2>
    <P><b>The field of statistics</b> is the science of <i></i> learning from data. Statistical knowledge helps you use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, and effectively present the results. <br> Statistics is a crucial process behind how we make discoveries in science, make decisions based on data, and make predictions.  <i></i> 
    <P> <i> Statistics are not just numbers and facts. You know, things like 4 out of 5 dentists prefer a specific toothpaste. Instead, itâ€™s an array of knowledge and procedures that allow you tolearn from data reliably.</i> <br>Statistics allow you to evaluate claims based on quantitative evidence and help you differentiate between reasonable and dubious conclusions.</P></i> <br></P>
        <P><i><b>As a Statistician</b></i> there is  a high demand in a variety of fields like<u>universities,research labs, government,etc </u> statistical knowledge comes handy in a lot of jobs .
